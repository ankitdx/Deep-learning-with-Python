# Deep Learning with Python

Here I will put some projects that I create while learning how to apply deep neural networks.
Current projects:
* Variational Autoencoder for creating MNIST characters (notebook with explanations)
* Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) for the same purpose (notebook with explanations)
* DCGAN for creating human faces
* Style Transfer
